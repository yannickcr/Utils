Utils
=====

You can find here some little utilities I'm using to make my work easier.

Some of these utilities were done with [AutoIt3][autoit].

List of utilities
-----------------

### GetText

Parse your HTML templates, PHP Files and/or Javascript Files to find all the strings to translate and create the related .pot file.

### GetText JS

Generate a Mootools dictionnary from your non-compiled translation files (.po) and your Javascript Files. (Feel free to fork it to make it compatible with other JS librairies).
